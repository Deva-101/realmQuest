Welcome to REALM QUEST, where you, a new adventurer, are tasked with exploring the realm and finding treasure.

Use WASD to change which cardinal direction you face.
Then, use WASD to move one tile at a time. Some tiles can't be walked through.

On your adventure, you may encounter some items in the world. To take an item, walk over
it. The item will appear in your inventory. You may need to scroll to see all of your items.

To use an item, click on it's button in your inventory.
Some items, like HEALTH POTIONS, are consumable, meaning they are gone once used.
Others, like SWORDS, may be used as many times as you want.

The world consists of many rooms, connected by DOORS.
Beware: Some DOORS are locked and require certain items to unlock.
You will encounter enemies! Walk into enemies with a weapon to damage them.

Always pay attention to your health bar at the top. If it reaches zero, then that's game over!
